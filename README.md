## How to use
Very simple. Just clone the project and open index.html in any browser which supports JavaScript.

## File Structure
[Skeleton Responsive CSS](http://getskeleton.com) is used in this project. So file structure is the same in Skeleton project. Only a javascript file is created by me (**QuranText.js**).

## License
You may use, edit, optimize the project. Only say a **SALAVAT** and use it :)

Any question, you may contact me at [my personal site](http://mstajbakhsh.ir)
